Bookmark Application 

## MVP user stories
* As a user, I can see a list of all my bookmarks when I visit the page
* As a user, I can click on one of my bookmarks and have it take me to the linked website
* As a user, I can create a new bookmark and see that it immediately loads on the page so that I know I successfully added a bookmark
* As a user, I can delete a bookmark so I can keep my list relevant
* As a user, I can update a bookmark in case I made a typo or the URL changed
